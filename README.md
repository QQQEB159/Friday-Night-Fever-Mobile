You're Fever, the mayor of Fever Town!  
A trip back from space caused you to crash here instead of home, and things began to pile up on your desk ever since. 
Once an abandoned spot on the map, it's now a hot spot for the worlds rejects, criminals, scumbags and any others shunned from their homes. 
Your girlfriend is also from space, and you're hiding some dark secrets from her... can you handle a relationship as well as you can handle being a mayor?
