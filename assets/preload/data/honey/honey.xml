	<action msg="Psychotic nun? Talking fruit? Horny shapeshifter? Dealing with the raccoons?" portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="This one's new. Someone in town gave me a letter, and told them to go to this spot at this time." portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="So, you're just gonna do it?" portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Might as well. Not like I had much to do." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Call me crazy, but I feel like this handwritings familiar... letter smells nice, too." portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="And anyways, I kinda have to, y'know." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="That rule where you HAVE to accept all challenges is pretty lame." portrait="tea" emotion="pointing"/>
	<action msg="Yeah, yeah- I know, hell. I'll change it soon, maybe after this." portrait="fever" emotion="embarrased"/>
	<action msg="Let's just go." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="There sure are a lot of limos in this parking lot." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral" narrate="..."/>
	<action msg="Maybe someone famous is in town?" portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="Oddly enough, Fever Town IS a hot vacation spot..." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Probably cause rules are so scarce here. Anyone can come into Fever Town, do shady shit, then probably leave without any repercussions." portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="I'm Hunni, but there's no need to tell you my name." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Cause after I beat you, the rest of the world will soon know." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Cherry here WOULD have just opened a portal to your location, but I forgot about the demon rule." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Uh, what's the demon rule?" portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="It's that demons can't summon a portal to another demons location. Cause y'know, it'd be rude for someone trying to take anothers soul to butt in." portrait="fever" emotion="embarrased"/>
	<action msg="Oh, so Hunni's also a demon?" portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="Me? That's cute. Let me introduce Cherry." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="Uh- okay, got me there." portrait="tea" emotion="worried"/>
	<action msg="Anyways, it's been a while huh Fever? Doesn't seem like you got much taller from the last time we met, though." portrait="cherry" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Not fair to say that when you're on top of that limo." portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="Then why dont you two hurry up and get on already? Unless you're already intimidated by our aura?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Pfft, intimidated? As if! Tea and I are a power couple, there's nothing that could-" portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>

	<action msg="Those... large, fluffy, white creatures. They look like..." portrait="tea" emotion="tea-pointing-wtf"/>
	<action msg="You mean the bunnies?" portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="Aren't they beautiful? Every one of them answer to me, and me only." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I guess you can say I'm their leader in a way." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="That's cute. Y'know, once you get past the fact they're freakishly large. Reminds me of..." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="You know it!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="I wasn't expecting this either... but hey, this just tips the scales in my favor. Not like you had any chance against me anyway." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I don't need someone backing me up to win! Tea's just a bonus!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="A very, very hot bonus." portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>
	<action msg="I can respect that mentality. I'm also used to having the most lovely individual in the world cheering me on~." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Aww! Hunni-" portrait="cherry" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="This cute bunny! And this one, and this one! Come to me! You're all gonna dance so well!" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="You sure are confident. Reminds me of an earlier time, huh?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Hunni..." portrait="fever" emotion="embarrased"/>
	<action msg="GET THE FUCK OFF MY CAR OR I WILL PISS MYSELF." portrait="food" emotion="angry"/>
