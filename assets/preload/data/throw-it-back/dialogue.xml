	<action msg="You think that YOU can entertain me with your idea of a weak ass show? Even after all that, you wanna humiliate me some more?" portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="I SAID I WAS SORRY." portrait="feverd" emotion="frown"/>
	<action msg="Seriously, this town is FULL of people from space, and you think I'm still lying to you?" portrait="feverd" emotion="frown"/>

	<action msg="And yet, right now, as much as I want to strangle you..." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="I just.. fucking can't. I can't." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="If you're telling the truth, and I can still hardly believe you, then this was all just a waste of time." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="But I really HOPE you are. That point of my life, having to tackle crowds, wondering if my friend would ever show up..." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="I really, really wanted to make it." portrait="feverd" emotion="frown"/>

	<action msg="I can't believe this." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="Ugh." portrait="hunni" emotion="angry"/>
	<action msg="Whatever. I'll listen to your dumbass story of &quot;space travels&quot;" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="What could they even want from you? You're a total softie." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="That's cap and you know it." portrait="feverd" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Fuck it. It'd be nice to perform without an audience watching for once." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I dunno if you can keep up with me, though. I'm probably leagues above you now." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Let's see. You first." portrait="feverd" emotion="point"/>
